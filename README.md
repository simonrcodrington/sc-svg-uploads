# WordPress SVG Uploads
A simple WordPress plugin that enables SVG uploads to the media library.

##How it works

The default icons used for your SVG uploads will be dynamically replaced with the SVG inline elements. This will make the media grid more useful.

You will be able to browse all attachments and easily find the SVG's you're looking for. 

###Additional elements
This plugin also tweaks a few admin areas to ensure your SVG's are displayed correctly such as:

- When viewing the media library and using the traditional column view, the preview image will be scaled correctly
- When viewing attachment details inside the grid view (the modal window displayed when viewing the grid view), the default icon will be replaced with your SVG
