# sc-svg-uploads
A simple WordPress plugin that enables SVG uploads to the media library.

The default icons used for your SVG uploads will be dynamically replaced with the SVG elements themselves, making the media grid more useful. You will be able to browse all attachments and easily find the SVG's you're looking for.

This plugin also tweaks a few admin areas to ensure your SVG's are displayed correctly, such as on the standard column based view of the media gallery and also when viewing attachment details inside the grid view (the modal window displayed when viewing the grid view)
